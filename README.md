# WEConnect

 WeConnect provides a platform that brings businesses and individuals together. 
This platform creates awareness for businesses and gives the users the ability to write reviews about the businesses they have interacted with. 

## FRONT-END (UI TEMPLATE)
**project design:**
- using pivotal tracker to create a roadmap for the client-side and server-side

- create a Github repository, add a README, and clone it yo your computer.

- create three directories in your local git repo.

- template: this directory will contain UI template for the front-end in HTML/CSS

- server:this directory will contain the back-end implementation in NodeJS-Express

- client: this directory will contain your front-end implementation in ReactJS and Redux

- build out the app's UI into the template directory 

- Host the UI template on Github pages

- **You are to create a _pull request to elicit review and feedback for the UI_ when you are done working on them.**
